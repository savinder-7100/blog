<p><b>Competitive edge:</b> Team, Approach, Ongoing Support</p><br>
<p><b>Location of our Business:</b>
Mississauga, Canada
As per the market research, Mississauga is the centre where I think we can spread out the word for my business. Taking care of the market competition, I think Mississauga is the right place to sell yourself.</p><br>
<p><b>Competition in our business area and location:</b>
As per the research I did, there are approximately 15 other Web designing companies offering the same services and miscellaneous as well. Taking care of the competition, the pricing and services need to be set up with discounts and by making trustworthy clients and helping them with productive work. 
Testimonials will be provided to the clients to help them know about us. </p>

<br><b>Ecommerce Startups:</b> Considering the new age of economic shift towards retail online shopping, we will be primarily targeting the emerging startups. With a technologically expert team and highly growth oriented marketing techniques, we will be supporting startups from step one and help them reach milestones. 

<b>Small to Medium-size Industry:</b> These companies need one stop solution for their business. Students, those people who actually want IT solutions, will also be our target clients as I will help them in most productive ways. My solutions will help my clients grow and succeed. With passing time, developing a trust with specific clients will help them and my agency grow as we will succeed. Different discounts will be provided to my clients, in addition to, asking to promote my business through either social networking or by referring me. </p>
