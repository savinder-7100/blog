Jump into building your own personal static website with this GatsbyJS template.

Don't know React or GatsbyJS? That's fine! This template embraces Jamstack
principles, and is set up to allow you to customize your site quickly without
actually interacting with the core of the frontend implementation.

The only thing you need to do is edit some markdown files in `data/`.

## Metadata

Metadata is contained within `data/meta.json`; this centralizes key site
information.

### `siteTitle`

The title of my website (displayed as the tab title).

### `siteDescription`

my site description (required for SEO, will be displayed in search engine
results).

### `siteUrl`

The URL of my site . When in development, go
ahead and supply the URL you expect to host your website at.

### `avatarUrl`

Avatar i made dynamic 



### `name`

My name display in footer 

### `location`

Location displayed at top

## Profile Content

Each markdown (`.md`) file in `data/` correlates to a section displayed on my
profile. The `title` frontmatter field of each file determines which profile tab
the content will be displayed in; possible values are: `Home`, `Resume`, 
`Blog`,`About`, and `Contact` (these should be unique).



## Deployment

This template is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages.

Edit `pathPrefix` in `gatsby-config.js` to be `/<Notion-project>` and run
`npm run deploy`. Then, navigate to your repository settings and enable GitHub
Pages with the `gh-pages` branch as Source. Your site should be deployed at

`https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<Notion-projec>`.

This site is deployed by using netlify and here's the link
